Working through Algorithm Design and Applications by Goodrich & Tamassia, based on my previous experience with Goodrich & Tamassia's Data Structures and Algorithms books.

Algorithm Design and Applications adds the challenge of only providing mathematical-style psuedocode of algorithms, rather than implementations in any particular programming language.

Implementations in Golang & Python

Code is over-commented for my own educational & reference purposes
